# Pastelitos-chips-Shopify-Store-Design
I recently designed a Shopify store that sells a unique food item called "Pastelito Chips". These chips are a delicious twist on the traditional Latin American pastry, Pastelitos. The chips are made with a flaky, buttery crust and filled with savory or sweet fillings, such as beef, cheese, guava, or dulce de leche. The Shopify store is designed to showcase the Pastelito Chips and make it easy for customers to purchase them online.
